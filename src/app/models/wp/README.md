This code comes from the open source project [**ngx-wordpress**](https://github.com/MurhafSousli/ngx-wordpress).

Right now the project does not support Angular 5, so I've taken only those models to make stuff easier, but in the long term it might be interesting to use directly that library.

P.S. [wp-api-angular](https://github.com/wordpress-clients/wp-api-angular) also seems a promising lib in the same line, altough it doesn't support v.5 yet, also.
